## What is HelpSmith?

**HelpSmith** is a sophisticated and feature-rich help authoring tool designed to empower software developers, technical writers, and product teams to create comprehensive, professional, and user-friendly documentation. It addresses the critical need for clear and accessible information that accompanies software applications, enhancing the overall user experience and reducing support requests.

This powerful application provides an integrated environment where you can write, design, manage, and publish your documentation projects to a wide array of standard formats. The core philosophy of HelpSmith is to streamline the entire documentation workflow, from the initial draft to the final published manual, making it an indispensable tool for anyone serious about providing quality user assistance.

Key advantages of utilizing HelpSmith for your documentation needs include a intuitive visual editor that mimics a word processor, eliminating the steep learning curve often associated with help authoring. It supports single-sourcing, allowing you to maintain one set of source files that can be published to CHM (Compiled HTML Help), responsive HTML websites, PDF documents, printable manuals, and e-books (ePub, Mobi), ensuring consistency across all delivery channels. Furthermore, it includes advanced features for managing large projects, conditional content for different audiences, and tools for capturing and annotating screenshots directly within the application.
